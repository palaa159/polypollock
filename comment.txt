My expectation was "to splash the color" because of Pollock name. So, it is a little bit surprise that the mouse control looks like this.

Why in 30 sec?
Perhaps, Users should be aware of 30 sec limitation before start, and may be there is countdown before it start?

The interface is inviting and simple to understand/navigate. Would be nice if there was more time to draw, more color options. or more effects to paint with. I like the idea of drawing with a name though, so maybe a few font choices or   text size choices. Still impressive!

I'm now in Madrid with a terrible internet connection, so perhaps that's why it didn't work. I couldn't see any artwork, though the FB login seemed to have worked (nice!)

It was fun! I likes that you could see others draw at first then draw yourself. I would like to see different font sizes if you login again. Like the more you login the larger the fonts get?!? maybe. Other wise nice work :)
